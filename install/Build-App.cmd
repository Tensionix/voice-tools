title Audion Voice Tools - Build App

rem Builds App\ from Source\: the window of the program, AudionVoiceTools.exe - the
rem capsule of dictation, the tray and the manager - and the PowerShell 7 it carries,
rem AudionPs.exe (the scripts of the builder run with it; no PowerShell is downloaded
rem or taken from the machine).
rem
rem Self-contained for win-x64: App\ carries its own .NET runtime, so the program
rem runs on a machine with nothing installed. The new copy is put together in
rem ._runtime\app_stage and checked there; App\ is replaced only by a copy that is
rem whole, so a failed build leaves the working one in place. The version comes
rem from config\version.json - the project file reads it - and is written into the
rem executables.
rem
rem The checks of the window run first: the console command the window calls for
rem files (tests\test_voice_cli.py) and the dictionary of the window - every Russian
rem text it shows has its English pair (Source\Tools\check_i18n.py). The built copy
rem then checks itself (--self-test): the answer of the console command reads, the
rem command line of a run, the service lines, the colours and the code pages;
rem --just-built adds that the number of the executable is the number of
rem config\version.json.
rem
rem Needs the .NET 10 SDK and the Python of the project (builder_main.cmd).
rem The step is run by hand when Source\ changes: a release does not rebuild the window.
rem
